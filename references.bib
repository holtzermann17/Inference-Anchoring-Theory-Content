  abstract      = {Automated reasoning is an enabling technology for many
                  applications of informatics. These applications include
                  verifying that a computer program meets its specification;
                  enabling a robot to form a plan to achieve a task and
                  answering questions by combining information from diverse
                  sources, e.g. on the Internet, etc. How is automated
                  reasoning possible? Firstly, knowledge of a domain must be
                  stored in a computer, usually in the form of logical
                  formulae. This knowledge might, for instance, have been
                  entered manually, retrieved from the Internet or perceived
                  in the environment via sensors, such as cameras. Secondly,
                  rules of inference are applied to old knowledge to derive
                  new knowledge. Automated reasoning techniques have been
                  adapted from logic, a branch of mathematics that was
                  originally designed to formalize the reasoning of humans,
                  especially mathematicians. My special interest is in the
                  way that representation and reasoning interact. Successful
                  reasoning is dependent on appropriate representation of
                  both knowledge and successful methods of reasoning.
                  Failures of reasoning can suggest changes of
                  representation. This process of representational change can
                  also be automated. We will illustrate the automation of
                  representational change by drawing on recent work in my
                  research group.},

                  are applied, in general, to the analysis and evaluation of
                  argumentative products, but little attention has been paid
                  to the creative process of arguing. Mathematics can be used
                  as a clear example to illustrate some significant
                  theoretical differences between mathematical practice and
                  the products of it, to differentiate the distinct
                  components of the arguments, and to emphasize the need to
                  address the different types of argumentative discourse and
                  argumentative situation in the practice. I consider some
                  issues of recent papers associated with mathematical
                  argumentation in an attempt to contribute to the discussion
                  about the role of arguing in mathematical practice and in
                  the evaluation of the products of this practice. I apply
                  this discussion to learning environments to defend the
                  thesis that argumentative practice should be encouraged
                  when teaching technical subjects to convey a better
                  understanding and to improve thought and creativity.",

abstract="The goal of this book is to explore the relationship between argumentation theory and the philosophy of mathematical practice. By `argumentation theory' we intend the study of reasoning and argument, and especially those aspects not addressed (or not addressed well) by formal deduction. The great success of formal logic in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries led to an eclipse of informal techniques, but a revival began in the 1950s. These pioneers initiated a thriving research tradition with particular strengths in Canada and the Netherlands. The philosophy of mathematical practice diverges from mainstream philosophy of mathematics in the emphasis it places on what the majority of working mathematicians actually do, rather than on mathematical foundations, an issue most mathematicians ignore (rightly or wrongly). This leads to a closer relationship with history and sociology of mathematics, mathematics education, and mathematics itself. In the last decade philosophy of mathematical practice has been developed further by many authors, but the potential argumentation theory holds for this work has mostly been overlooked. This collection is designed to remedy that oversight.",

                  linguistic theories, the hypothesis that proof is a special
                  case of argumentation is put forward and Toulmin's model is
                  proposed as a methodological tool to compare them. This
                  model can be used to detect and analyse the structure of an
                  argumentation supporting a conjecture (abduction,
                  induction, etc.) and the structure of its proof. The aim of
                  the paper is to highlight the importance of structural
                  analysis between argumentation and proof. This analysis
                  shows that although there are clear cases of continuity
                  between argumentation supporting a conjecture and its
                  proof, there is often a structural distance between the two
                  (from an abductive argumentation to a deductive proof, from

                  machines for about 60 years and have learned a great deal
                  about composition and abstraction, we have just begun to
                  scratch the surface. A mammalian neuron takes about ten
                  milliseconds to respond to a stimulus. A driver can respond
                  to a visual stimulus in a few hundred milliseconds, and
                  decide an action, such as making a turn. So the
                  computational depth of this behavior is only a few tens of
                  steps. We don't know how to make such a machine, and we
                  wouldn't know how to program it. The human genome -- the
                  information required to build a human from a single,
                  undifferentiated eukariotic cell -- is about 1GB. The
                  instructions to build a mammal are written in very dense
                  code, and the program is extremely flexible. Only small
                  patches to the human genome are required to build a cow or
                  a dog rather than a human. Bigger patches result in a frog
                  or a snake. We don't have any idea how to make a
                  description of such a complex machine that is both dense
                  and flexible. New design principles and new linguistic
                  support are needed. I will address this issue and show some
                  ideas that can perhaps get us to the next phase of
                  engineering design.}

                  (constructive activities). This article investigates the
                  extent to which constructive activities, dialogic
                  transactivity, and dialectic transactivity generated by
                  either the learner or the learning partner can explain the
                  positive effects of collaboration scripts and heuristic
                  worked examples on the learners' disposition to use
                  argumentation skills. We conducted a 2 {\texttimes} 2
                  experiment with the factors collaboration script and
                  heuristic worked examples with N = 101 math teacher
                  students. Results showed that the learners' engagement in
                  self-generated dialectic transactivity (i.e., responding to
                  the learning partner's contribution in an argumentative way
                  by critiquing and/or integrating their learning partner's
                  contributions) mediated the effects of both scaffolds on
                  their disposition to use argumentation skills, whereas
                  partner-generated dialectic transactivity or any other
                  measured collaborative learning activity did not. To
                  support the disposition to use argumentation skills in
                  mathematics, learning environments should thus be designed
                  in a way to help learners display dialectic transactivity.
                  Future research should investigate how learners might
                  better benefit from the dialectic transactivity generated
                  by their learning partners.",

abstract="Argumentation theory is a new research area that concerns mainly with reaching a mutually acceptable conclusion using logical reasoning. Argumentation can be defined as a proof of dynamic nature and is considered as an ill-defined domain that typically lacks clear distinctions between ``right'' and ``wrong'' answers. Instead, there are often competing reasonable answers. Recently, a number of argument mapping tools have been developed to diagram, articulate, and comprehend different arguments. Despite the fact, these methods are of complementary nature, and the efforts for integrating these tools are missing. The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) revealing a novel approach for argument representation using a structured relational argument database ``RADB'', which has been designed, developed, and implemented in order to represent different argument analyses and diagrams, (2) presenting a classifier agent that utilizes the RADB repository by using different mining techniques in order to retrieve the most relevant arguments to the subject of search, and (3) proposing an agent-based educational environment (ALES) that utilizes the RABD together with the classifier agent to teach argument analysis.",

abstract="Argumentation schemes are forms of reasoning that are fallible but correctable within a self-correcting framework. Their use provides a basis for taking rational action or for reasonably accepting a conclusion as a tentative hypothesis, but they are not deductively valid. We argue that teleological reasoning can provide the basis for justifying the use of argument schemes both in monological and dialogical reasoning. We consider how such a teleological justification, besides being inspired by the aim of directing a bounded cognizer to true belief and correct choices, needs to take into account the attitudes of dialogue partners as well as normative models of dialogue and communicative activity types, in particular social and cultural settings.",

journal={Argumentation},
year="2017",

pages="245--266",
abstract="In this paper a dialogue game for critical discussion is developed. The dialogue game is a formalisation of the ideal discussion model that is central to the pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation. The formalisation is intended as a preparatory step to facilitate the development of computational tools to support the pragma-dialectical study of argumentation. An important dimension of the pragma-dialectical discussion model is the role played by speech acts. The central issue addressed in this paper is how the speech act perspective can be accommodated in the formalisation as a dialogue game. The starting point is an existing `basic' dialogue game for critical discussion, in which speech acts are not addressed. The speech act perspective is introduced into the dialogue game by changing the rules that govern the moves that can be made and the commitments that these result in, while the rules for the beginning, for the end, and for the structure of the dialogue game remain unchanged. The revision of the move rules is based on the distribution of speech acts in the pragma-dialectical discussion model. The revision of the commitment rules is based on the felicity conditions that are associated with those speech acts.",

year="2017",
volume="30",
number="2",
pages="209--238",
abstract="In spite of significant research efforts, argument technologies do not seem poised to scale up as much as most commentators would hope or even predict. In this paper, I discuss what obstacles bar the way to more widespread success of argument technologies and venture some suggestions on how to circumvent such difficulties: doing so will require a significant shift in how this research area is typically understood and practiced. I begin by exploring a much broader yet closely related question: To what extent are people natively good at arguing? This issue has always been central to philosophical reflection and it has become even more urgent nowadays, with the explosion of persuasive technologies and unprecedented opportunities for large-scale social influence. The answer hinges on what aspect of argumentation is taken under consideration: evidence suggests that people are relatively bad at analyzing the structure of arguments, especially when these are presented out of context and in abstract terms; in contrast, data show that even laymen tend to excel in the interactive practice of argumentation, in particular when motivation is high and something significant is at stake. Unfortunately, current argument technologies are more closely tailored to the former type of activity than to the latter, which is the main reason behind their relative lack of success with the general public. Changing this state of affair will require a commitment to ecological argument technologies: that is, technologies designed to support real-time, engaging and meaningful argumentative interactions performed by laypeople in their ordinary life, instead of catering to the highly specific needs of a minority of niche users (typically, argumentation scholars).",

It already hosts the largest publicly accessible corpora of argumentation and has the largest number of interoperable and cross compatible tools for the analysis, navigation and evaluation of arguments across a broad range of domains, languages and activity types. Such interoperability is key in allowing innovative combinations of tool and data reuse that can further catalyse the development of the field of computational argumentation.

abstract="The growing use of the internet for collaboration, and of numeric and symbolic software to perform calculations it is impossible to do by hand, not only augment the capabilities of mathematicians, but also afford new ways of observing what they do. In this essay we look at four case studies to see what we can learn about the everyday practice of mathematics: the polymath experiments for the collaborative production of mathematics, which tell us about mathematicians attitudes to working together in public; the minipolymath experiments in the same vein, from which we can examine in finer grained detail the kinds of activities that go on in developing a proof; the mathematical questions and answers in math overflow, which tell us about mathematical-research-in-the-small; and finally the role of computer algebra, in particular the GAP system, in the production of mathematics. We conclude with perspectives on the role of computational logic.",

publisher="Springer Netherlands",

abstract="Two influential views in argumentation theory about the relative status of argument and mathematical proofs are discussed first. One is Perelman's fundamental principle that argument and proofs are radically different objects, the other is Johnson's view that an argument has two faces: an illative core and a dialectical tier that would be lacking in the case of a proof. Then, I develop the idea that proofs are not foreign to arguments but are rather milestones for arguments, blooming before, during and after them.",
